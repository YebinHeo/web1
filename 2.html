    <p style="margin-top:45px;">Dora Balla, graphic designer, researcher. <br>
      She graduated from the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design in 1998.<br>
      This is where she defended her <strong>doctoral dissertation</strong> as well and she works here as a professor since 2007. <br>
      Her primary field of study and research is the history of contemporary graphic design and its Hungarian aspects,<br>
      as well as the visual grammar and development of contemporary graphic design. <br>
      She is the author, editor and designer of many books and websites that deals <br>
      with the development of the modern teaching methodologies. </p>
      <p>
      Her designer work can be described by the organic integration of professional research, <br>
      the autonomous, analytic and vigorously experimental approach. <br>
      As an independent studio she is working primarily for procurers of the cultural sphere <br>
      and she is experimenting with creative materials and new printing possibilities. <br>
      Since 2015 she has been publishing several art books based on <strong>complex graphic and typographic projects</strong><br>
      and as an exhibiting artist she is an active member of the Hungarian and international graphic and art life.</p>
